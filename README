Balloon Stat Project

Code for receiving a signal from a Dual Band FM Transceiver, processing the transmitted 
code and activating a servo on the Balloon Stat to cut the string between the balloon 
and the hardware.  

Intended use is for early release to prevent situations where the Balloon Stat will not 
be retrievable.  For example: If the projected landing area is in a body of water early 
release of the payload will allow the data to be retrieved. Also if the projected landing
zone is a heavily wooded area with a high chance that the balloon will get stuck in a tree.

Current setup is an Arduino Uno with the interface using a Raspberry Pi 3.  The Arduino 
is connected to a Ham Shield Mini, to receive signals, and a servo.
